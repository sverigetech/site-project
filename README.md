My First Cloudsecurity & Devops project!

Welcome to my very first GitHub repository!  
This project marks the culmination of my Cloud Security and DevOps training journey.

What This Project Is About

In this repository, I will:

- Set up my first virtual machine (VM) using a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Install and configure an application to run on the VM
- Learn and apply essential DevOps and cloud security practices along the way

Technologies I Plan to Use

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
- Cloud Provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Shell Scripting / Bash
- Basic firewall rules, SSH configuration, and secure deployment
- nginx for web hosting

What You’ll Find Here

As the project progresses, I’ll add:

- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Configuration files & scripts
- Notes and learnings from the journey
- Security hardening steps I apply

Why I’m Doing This

I’m learning to become a Cloud Security Specialist and DevOps Engineer.  
This repository will document my hands-on practice and growth — from spinning up VMs to running secure cloud-native apps.

This is a beginner project — feedback, tips, or suggestions are always welcome!
